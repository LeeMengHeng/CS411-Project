As a logged in user, when I see a star in the nightsky,
I want to know what's happening there by just openning the app and focus on the star in my camera. 
After a short period of loading, there should be some tags poped out with information about the star.
The tags should include the information such as the name, the temperature of the star right now, its distance to th earth etc.
If the star is connected to a constellation, then the tag should include general information about the constellation
If the identification goes wrong, a tag with message "Failed identification, please try again" will show up.
