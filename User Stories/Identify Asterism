As an logged in user of this system, I would want to be able to upload a picture of the night sky that has a large asterism that 
I want to identify or know about of. For example, If there is an unknown asterism that I dont know, such as Big Dipper. I will want to have the ability
to take a picture and upload it to the system and have the system identify it for me.
