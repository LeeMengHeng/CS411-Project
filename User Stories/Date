As a logged in user, I will want to choose the date that I've taken this photo. This is because different season will have different 
constellation and asterism.

Once the user finished setting up their location. They will move on to select the date.

I will want to have a list of dates when that I have taken a picture in and organize them by latest to earliest. That way we have a organized photo album according to the dates
