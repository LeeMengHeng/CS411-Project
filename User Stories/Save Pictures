As an user, I want the system to have the ability to save pictures that I have uploaded in the past. If it does not allow me to save pictures,
the system has to show why. The reasons of failure can be user not logged into his/her account or the maximum number of saved photos exceeded. If user
did not logged into his/her account. It should be referenced to account user story.
